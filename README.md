# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a Python-based application that automates attendance using face recognition technology. It uses a webcam to capture live video, detects and recognizes faces from a preloaded dataset, and logs attendance with timestamps in a CSV file. A Tkinter-based GUI makes it easy to start and stop attendance, view the attendance sheet in a table format, and reset the records when needed. The system highlights recognized faces in green, marks unknown faces in red, and ensures that each studentâ€™s name is logged only once per session. 

The goal of this project is to replace traditional manual attendance with a faster, contactless, and more reliable system that can be applied in classrooms, offices, or events.
